    "### 1. Caesar Cipher\n",
    "- **History:** The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known ciphers. Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE), the Roman general and statesman, used it to protect military messages by shifting each letter three positions forward in the alphabet. It represents the first documented use of substitution in cryptography. Variants of the Caesar Cipher were still seen centuries later in basic military communication, but it was largely abandoned as literacy and cryptanalysis advanced.   \n",
    "- **Method:** Shift every letter by a fixed amount $k \\bmod 26$.  \n",
    "- **Encrypt:** $C = P + k \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Decrypt:** $P = C - k \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Key space:** 25 possible non-trivial keys.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Easy brute-force search. Subject to frequency analysis.  \n",
    "- **Current Usage:** Educational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Affine Cipher\n",
    "- **History:** The Affine Cipher emerged much later as an algebraic generalization of Caesar. It reflects the rise of modular arithmetic in 18th–19th century mathematics. By using both multiplication and addition in the encryption function, it was designed to appear more secure than a simple shift. Despite this, once modular arithmetic and frequency analysis were understood, the cipher’s weakness became clear. It was used mainly in recreational or educational contexts, not in state or military communication.   \n",
    "- **Method:** Uses linear function with parameters $a$ and $b$ where $\\gcd(a,26)=1$.  \n",
    "- **Encrypt:** $C = aP + b \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Decrypt:** $P = a^{-1}(C-b) \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Key space:** 312 possible $(a,b)$ pairs.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Two plaintext-ciphertext pairs reveal key. Subject to frequency analysis.  \n",
    "- **Current Usage:** Educational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Monoalphabetic Substitution\n",
    "- **History:** Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers were the dominant cryptographic tool from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance. European diplomats and monarchs relied heavily on these ciphers to protect correspondence. The technique was seriously challenged after the Arab mathematician al-Kindī described frequency analysis in the 9th century, marking the birth of modern cryptanalysis. Despite this, simple substitution remained in use for centuries because many adversaries lacked the literacy or expertise to apply cryptanalysis.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Any fixed permutation of the alphabet.  \n",
    "- **Key space:** $26!$ (about $4 \\times 10^{26}$).  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Frequency analysis and pattern recognition.  \n",
    "- **Current Usage:** Educational, puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polyalphabetic Substitution (Vigenère Cipher)\n",
    "- **History:** First described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso and later popularized by Blaise de Vigenère in 1586, this polyalphabetic substitution cipher gained a reputation as “le chiffre indéchiffrable” (the indecipherable cipher). It resisted frequency analysis because multiple alphabets were used, masking single-letter statistics. For over 300 years, it was believed unbreakable until Charles Babbage and Friedrich Kasiski independently developed methods in the mid-1800s to determine key length and reduce the cipher to a set of Caesar ciphers. It was still used in the 19th century for private and military correspondence.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Use a repeating keyword, each letter of the keyword indicates a Caesar shift.  \n",
    "- **Key space:** $26^L$ for a key of length $L$.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Kasiski examination and Friedman test can reveal key length; then frequency analysis breaks each Caesar stream.  \n",
    "- **Usage:** 16th–19th century correspondence.\n",

    "<!-- ## Transposition Ciphers -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Columnar Transposition\n",
    "- **History:** Transposition ciphers gained prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with columnar transposition becoming a standard field cipher. It was widely employed during World War I and II, sometimes in multiple layers to increase security. For instance, German and British forces both relied on transposition techniques before the development of rotor machines. Though stronger than simple substitution, single transpositions still yielded to frequency and pattern analysis.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Write plaintext into a grid row-wise, permute columns according to a key, then read off column by column.  \n",
    "- **Key space:** $n!$ where $n$ is the number of columns.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Reconstructable via anagramming and statistical methods.  \n",
    "- **Current Usage:** Educational, puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Rail Fence Cipher\n",
    "- **History:** A transposition cipher dating back to at least the 18th–19th century. Its zig-zag writing method made it easy to perform without tables or machines, which gave it appeal for military use in the American Civil War. Despite its simplicity, it demonstrates the principle of transposition and diffusion of plaintext letters. Over time, it became more of a teaching example than a serious security measure.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Write text diagonally across $r$ rails, then read row by row.  \n",
    "- **Key space:** About $N-2$ keys for a message of length $N$.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Brute force small number of rails; patterns are visible.  \n",
    "- **Current Usage:** Educational, puzzles.\n",

    "---\n",

    "<!-- ## Advanced Classical Systems -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Hill Cipher\n",
    "- **History:** Introduced in 1929 by American mathematician Lester S. Hill, this was the first cipher to apply linear algebra to encryption. It was a step toward modern block ciphers, encrypting groups of letters as vectors multiplied by a key matrix. While mathematically innovative, its vulnerability to known-plaintext attacks limited its adoption. It never saw widespread military use, but it remains historically significant as a conceptual bridge between classical and modern cryptography.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Block cipher using invertible matrix multiplication modulo 26.  \n",
    "- **Encrypt:** $C = K \\times P \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Decrypt:** $P = K^{-1} \\times C \\pmod{26}$  \n",
    "- **Key space:** Number of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices mod 26. For $n=2$, 157,248 keys; for $n=3$, about $1.6 \\times 10^{12}$ keys.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Known-plaintext attack can solve for key matrix; chosen-plaintext attacks trivial.  \n",
    "- **Usage:** Educational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. One-Time Pad\n",
    "- **History:** Patented by Gilbert Vernam in 1919 as a telegraph cipher using a repeating key. Joseph Mauborgne, a U.S. Army officer, realized that using a key only once would yield perfect secrecy, creating the one-time pad. During World War II and the Cold War, OTPs were used in espionage and diplomatic communications. The Soviet Union famously employed OTPs, but their repeated use of key material allowed U.S. and British cryptanalysts to break into their traffic in the VENONA project (1940s–1980s). Despite its impracticality for large-scale communication, it remains the only cipher with mathematically proven perfect secrecy.  \n",
    "- **Method:** Key is truly random, as long as the message. Combine with plaintext by modular addition or XOR.  \n",
    "- **Key space:** $26^N$ for $N$ letters, $2^N$ for $N$ bits.  \n",
    "- **Security:** Provides perfect secrecy if the key is random, used once, and secret.  \n",
    "- **Vulnerabilities:** Key reuse leads to devastating attacks; generating and sharing large keys is impractical.  \n",
    "- **Usage:** Used historically in high-security communication; still used in rare niche applications.\n",
